1. how the Connecting state come out
a. at this moment(2015-8-3), in my design ,there are no connection pool, so the connection made by a callback resigned to listen callback and the state of a connection just connected
b. when adding connection poosl ,we get connection from the connection pools ,and the states of a selected connection changed from DISCONNECT to CONNECTION, and when accept OK,and when
connetion init ok ,it turn to connnected

2. onProcess , this state do what for
a. for http, when the http request parser already done, then process request ,produce response
b. for more , this just protocol process
